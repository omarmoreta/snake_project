# Node.js: JavaScript on the Server Side

### Activity: Snake Names

In this activity, students install a package to learn about npm, npm packages, and package.json:
[snake-names](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snake-names)

Notes:

- I am using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for this project. To generate current node version for project in a `.nvmrc` file run the following command: `node -v > .nvmrc`

- If nvm not found error is displaying after running `nvm use` try `source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh` and rerun use command again.
